#SassBomb

This code is a prank.

It exists for the sole purpose of infurating other people. It's a naive
recursive fibonacci sequence function, and it should hang indefinitely on
whatever machine is unfortunate enough to run it.

To use the SassBomb, include this code in your main Sass files and uncomment
the final line. Who would expect such an nasty issue to be in an .scss file?
