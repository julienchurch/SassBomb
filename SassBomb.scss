/* FibBomb */

// This code is a prank.

// It exists for the sole purpose of infurating other people. It's a naive
// recursive fibonacci sequence function, and it should hang indefinitely on
// whatever machine is unfortunate enough to run it.

// To use the FibBomb, include this code in your main Sass files and uncomment
// the final line. Who would expect such an nasty issue to be in an .scss file?

@function fib($num) {
    @if ($num <= 1) {
        @return $num;
    }
    @return (fib($num - 1) + fib($num - 2))
}

// UNCOMMENT THE BELOW LINE TO USE
/* $fibBomb: fib(100); */
